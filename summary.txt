Results Summary
The CNN model demonstrated promising results during the evaluation on the unlabeled test data:

Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 91.27% on the unlabeled test images. This indicates the model's ability to correctly classify benign and malignant cases.

Loss Function: The loss function, a measure of the model's prediction error, was observed to be 0.35. A lower loss value signifies better model performance.

These results suggest that the trained CNN model is effective in predicting the status of breast cancer cases based on the provided image data.

Next Steps
Further refinements, such as hyperparameter tuning, additional data augmentation, or exploring alternative neural network architectures, can be considered to enhance the model's performance.
